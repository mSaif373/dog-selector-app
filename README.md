Project Overview
This project is a scaffolded setup that integrates Vite, a fast build tool for modern JavaScript projects, with React, a popular library for building user interfaces. Vite provides near-instantaneous development server startup and incredibly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to make your development experience smooth and efficient. React offers a declarative approach to building UI components, making it easier to create interactive and reusable user interfaces.
